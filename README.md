A project I made made with a friend for CodeTN in late 2016/early 2017. The goal was to allow students to find their bus routes and administrators to easily change them. It didn't end up being used, but I learned Node.js, how to use a hashing algorithm, and how to unit test code. My friend did the HTML/CSS and I did all the JS.

I tried to run this for the first time in a long time, and one problem I ran into is that I forgot to seed the database by uncommenting the seed command in `./app.js`. Another problem is that the Google Maps API changed. I just now updated my account, and I got a 1 year free trial, but it may not work in the future after my free trial expires.
